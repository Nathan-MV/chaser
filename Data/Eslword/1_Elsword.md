    ```
    Elsword can utilize the energy gained through attacks and skills into two types of auras: Aura of Vitality and Aura of Destruction.

    - Aura of Vitality helps Elsword recover mana faster by 200% (150% in PvP) through certain commands and allows him to use skills labeled as "Vitality skills" at a lower MP cost, enabling him to make the most out of his MP pool.
    - Aura of Destruction helps Elsword do more damage by increasing the damage of his heavy attacks and skills labeled as "Destruction skills" by 100% and 50%, respectively.
